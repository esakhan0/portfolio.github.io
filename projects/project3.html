    <h1 class="postTitle">My Experience Building Multiple PC's&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="sub">
    I built 2 gaming pc's and 1 office p, read below on how I found it!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>1st PC&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> The first PC I ever built was for my brother. It was an exciting and enlightening experience because I was learning everything from scratch,&nbsp; from assembling components to organizing cables and configuring the system. Building this PC revealed how all the parts interact and gave me the confidence to continue constructing and upgrading systems. It was the project that truly launched my passion for PC building and hardware. When building the PC, I started with the case. I unboxed it, removed the panels, and prepared it so I could work inside easily. I installed the motherboard into the case first and secured it properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, I installed the power supply so I could begin organising and routing cables early. Next, I carefully installed the CPU onto the motherboard and then attached the CPU cooler to maintain low temperatures. Once that was done, I installed the GPU into the PCIe slot and secured it to the case. I then added the case fans to improve airflow and cooling. After all the hardware was installed, I wired everything up&nbsp; and connected the power cables, front panel connectors, storage, and fans. I spent time tidying the build, zip-tying cables, and making sure everything looked clean and had good airflow. Once everything was connected and organised, the build was complete and ready to power on.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>2nd PC</h2>
    <p> After successfully building my brother’s PC and learning the basics, I decided to upgrade my own setup and create something more powerful and modern. I replaced most of the core components, including the case, motherboard, CPU, and storage, to improve performance and give the system a fresh new look. I kept my GPU from the previous build because it was still strong and reliable, and built the rest of the system around it. I followed a proper build process by installing the motherboard into the case first, then the power supply to help organise cables, followed by the CPU, cooler, GPU, and fans.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Once all the components were installed, I wired everything up and carefully managed the cables using zip ties to keep the build clean and improve airflow. My current setup now includes an RTX 4060 Ti, an ASUS TUF motherboard, 32GB RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a 4TB HDD. This upgraded system runs smoothly and handles everything I need, including gaming, coding, and hosting servers. Upgrading my own PC helped me improve my confidence with hardware, cable management, and troubleshooting, and it showed me how rewarding it is to build and customise a system yourself.</p>
    <h2>3rd PC</h2>
    <p>I also built an office PC for my mum using parts from my old computer. We started this project because I wanted to clean the case properly and make the system look and feel like a brand new PC instead of just an old reused one. Rather than throwing away my previous components, I realised they were still perfectly usable. I kept the same CPU, motherboard, case, and fans from my old setup and added a basic office GPU so the computer would be ideal for everyday tasks like browsing, documents, and general work. To do this, I had to completely take the PC apart and rebuild it from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I had already removed all the parts and packed them into boxes because I originally thought I would throw the case away. Once I decided to reuse it, I cleaned the case thoroughly and began rebuilding the system piece by piece. I reinstalled the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and all other components, bolted everything back into place, wired it up, and organised the cables neatly so it looked like a fresh build. In the end, I successfully created a clean, reliable office PC for my mum using recycled parts, showing how older hardware can still be given a new life with the right approach.&nbsp;</p>
